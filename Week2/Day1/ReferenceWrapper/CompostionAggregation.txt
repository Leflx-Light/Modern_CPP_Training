if you take pointer of class B in class A 
we say that class A is composed with class B as a member .


if you take reference of class B in class A 
we say that class A is aggregated with class B as a member .





Composition : if class A object is destroyed, attached class B object is also supposed to be destroyed.

Aggregation : if class A object is destroyed, attached class B object should not get destroyed.
