Objective:
     Make 3 lambda functions and 1 adaptor functions in the functionalities section.
        - Each lambda takes one vector of integer and returns void
    Lambda Functions are:
        1.) Lambda function to find first element of the vector.
        2.) Lambda function to find last element of the vector.
        3.) Lambda function to return the size of the vector.
Adaptor must accept ONLY ONE OF THE ABOVE LAMBDAS at a time along with a container of integers
