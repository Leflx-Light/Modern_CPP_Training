Abstraction
          - Not providing the implementation details so that 
          a) It can be provided at a later point in the code hierarchy.
          b) We can explain functionality without significant focus on implementation details.
Inheritance
          - Either you specialize the implementation for the specific sub-category
                        OR
          - you develop logic which can be generalized to many types.

Polymorphism
         - doing an action in more than one way
Encapsulation

Class & objects

Composition

Aggregation

Association

Go - programming language 
there is no class keyword, object, method overloading, Inheritance.
Go - supports OOPS.

OOPS - 3 conditions to satisfy
1.there should be way to create model or template or blueprint for your data.
2.there should be way to represent state of data.
3.you should be able to execute functions based on type of data. (type specific functions.)

smalltalk - pure oops
