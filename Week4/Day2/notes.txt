Algorithms covered:

1. std::count_if : count instances matching condition.
2. std::find_if  : find the position of the first isntance that satisfies the conditon.
3. std::all_of   : return true if all of the instances match condition, false otherwise.
4. std::any_of   : return true if any one of the instances match condition, false otherwise.
5. std::none_of  : return true, only when NONE of the instances match condition, false otherwise.
6. std::copy     : copy all elements from source to destination unconditionally.
7. std::copy_of  : copy elements that satisfy condition from source to destination.
             Note: remember to set size, copy_if and then resize using distance.
8. std::accumulate : aggregate multiple elements into 1 by performing a progressive, binary operation of your choice.
9. std::max_element : find the position of the first max elemet [based on comparator]
10. std::min_element: find the position of the first min element [based on comparator]


problem 1: Don't remember the syntax properly!
Solution: Never copy the code without understanding the syntax!


problem 2: Don't know how to read pop-ups and intellisense messages!
Solution :
