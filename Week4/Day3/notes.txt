Time Complexity: 

for(int i=0;i<row;i++){
    for(int j=0;j<columns;j++){
        std::cout<<i*j<<"\n";
    }
}


Linear Search
operation: Access item and compare!
N : size of elements to be checked.
Time complexity: O(N)

Time complexity is not measured in units of time!
Time complexity is always concerned about "How many operations" per input elements.

Steps to analize Time complexity:
1. Always find relation between N (number of input items) and operation where "operation" is context specific.
eg: In linear search, opertion is "access element and compare"
    In binary search, operation is "check middle, if found, okay else divide".



eg: Return a boolean to indicate whether at least one car has price over 7 lacs.
